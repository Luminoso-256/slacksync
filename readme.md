# SlackMsgMirror

## About

A simple (and rather hacky!) tool to mirror slack messages to discord. Thrown together for a one-off usecase, will likely not be maintained.

## Running

If, for whatever reason, you want to make use of this tool, `config.json` and a (relatively) short `main.go` should be explanatory enough.

`users.json`, `channels.json`, and `usergroups.json` can be generated by use of a script, converted from a slack backup (which is what I did), etc.
